| ![me at JMM 2024!](assets/images/headshot_JMM.jpg){:height="200px" width="200px"} | | Hello! My name is Genevieve (Vievie) Romanelli. I'm an incoming second-year math PhD student at CUNY Graduate Center. I like doing smooth math in places it doesn't really belong (currently, characterizing properties of energy forms on graphs with just enough structure). |
